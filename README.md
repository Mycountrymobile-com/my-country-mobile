    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    - For **PHP** and Composer:

    ```

4. Set up your environment (database, configuration, API keys):

    USE mycountrymobile;

    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255),
        phone VARCHAR(15)
    );

    CREATE TABLE messages (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INT,
        content TEXT,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the various tools and services provided by **My Country Mobile**. The repository includes code to demonstrate the core functionality of **SMS sending**, **user management**, and **message logging**. Here's a brief overview of how you can interact with the system:

1. **Send SMS**: The `public/index.php` file demonstrates how to send SMS using our service. You can integrate this functionality into your own projects by using the `SmsService.php` class, which interacts with the SMS API.
2. **Store Messages and Users**: The application interacts with a simple MySQL database to store user data and messages. You can extend this functionality to track more detailed information and perform advanced analytics.

To start the application locally, you can use PHP's built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to see the functionality in action.
